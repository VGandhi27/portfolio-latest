      web development, and data analysis. I completed my studies at <strong>Echelon Institute of Technology, Faridabad</strong>, 
      and I hold a degree in Computer Science And Engineering.

      During my time at university, I conducted research under Dr. Monika Goyal and Dr. Stuti Saxena, focusing on emerging 
      technologies and applications in data science. I published two research papers: <strong>"SVM-Based Framework for Breast Cancer 
        Detection"</strong> and <strong>"Analysing the Causes of Mood Disorders: A Comprehensive Study."</strong>

      project won second place. I also write tech blogs on Hashnode, exploring topics in AI and NLP.
